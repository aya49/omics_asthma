# asthma ER vs DR
  
  **purpose**: human asthma patients experience an asthma attack or constriction in their airways upon contact with allergens. a subgroup of these patients will recover after their initial attack. however, some will suffer from inflammation some hours later.
- hence this project aims to find biomarkers that differentiates between patents who
- will (dual response DR) and
- will not suffer from this second wave of inflammation (early response ER)
- from blood sampled
- before allergen contact and
- a few hours after the initial asthma attack (theoretically some time before a possible second wave of inflammation).
