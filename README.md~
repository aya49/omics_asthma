# asthma ER vs DR

**purpose**: human asthma patients experience an asthma attack or constriction in their airways upon contact with allergens. a subgroup of these patients will recover after their initial attack. however, some will suffer from inflammation some hours later.
- hence this project aims to find biomarkers that differentiates between patents who
  - will (dual response DR) and
  - will not suffer from this second wave of inflammation (exacerbation ER)
- from blood sampled
  - before allergen contact and
  - a few hours after the initial asthma attack (theoretically some time before a possible second wave of inflammation).


**input**:
- data
  - RNAseq (.fastq files)
  - Genotyping (affymetrix axiom .calls matrix): note there is one genotyping DNA data per patient

- folder structure before running anything

## Data pre-processing



### RNAseq

#### input raw fastq > output sample x base/isoform/gene matrix of counts/abundence
1. install packages required: **fastqc** > **star** > **rsem**
  - one of the easiest ways to do this is via [python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python) and then [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#installing-conda-on-a-system-that-has-other-python-installations-or-packages) after which you can create an environment to install your packages in. click on the links to see how to do this in your respective operating system. see below for an example in linux.

```bash

#install miniconda
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

#create an environment to install the packages in
conda env create --name myenv_py3 --file environment.yaml

#install the packages via conda; searchable via https://anaconda.org/
conda install -c bioconda fastqc
conda install -c bioconda star
conda install -c bioconda rsem

#conda install -c r r #r packages for putting together the final matrix; optional
#conda install -c r r-dplyr 

#load the environment
source activate myenv_py3

```


2. given a folder of raw fastq files, run fastQC (optional if fastQC is already done), STAR (map transcripts to the organism's genome e.g. [GRC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc)), and RSEM (get abundence). to do so, first **write the raw fastq file paths into [config.yaml](./config.yaml)** (we write all the file names to keep a record, you can also specify a folder) and then run [Snakefile](./Snakefile) (adapted from the (Sakemake pipeline)[https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]). see below for an example in linux. note: if there is more than one run of a sample (i.e. more than one fastq file per sample), put them together!

```bash
#write raw fastq file paths into config.yaml
#run snakemake; its configurations and parameters are in config.yaml
snakemake -np --cores 6 #dry run
snakemake -p --cores 6 #actual run; change the number of cores as needed

```

3. given the <sample>.<genes/isoforms>.results rsem output files for each fastq file, ([nice link](https://ycl6.gitbooks.io/rna-seq-data-analysis/quantification_using_rsem1.html)) consolidate them into a count matrix

```bash
#run count1.sh
chmod u+x count1.sh
./count1.sh

```





### genotype (Affymetrix Axiom)
- converting probe id to SNP id: [GeneChip Array Annotation Files](https://www.thermofisher.com/ca/en/home/life-science/microarray-analysis/microarray-data-analysis/genechip-array-annotation-files.html)


#### imputation
using plink to infer continuous probabilistic values for missing SNPs using reference HapMap data; original tutorial [here](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/pimputation.shtml).
- download [plink 6.1](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) (linked 20180531) and unzip into the **plink** folder.

- download [hapmap reference data](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/res.shtml) (linked 20180531) for whichever race / all races you prefer and unzip into the **hapmap** folder.
